Natural language processing enhances social listening by isolating sentiment, identifying topic keywords, and recognizing named entities such as product names or brands. This helps businesses monitor reputation, track market perception, and discover trending issues. Entity-aware sentiment provides deeper insight because it reveals not only whether users feel positive or negative, but exactly what they are responding to. Social listening tools use these techniques to categorize conversations at scale and detect emerging opportunities or risks.",

    "body_markdown": "Feedback is often complex, blending factual descriptions with personal opinions. By combining subjectivity scores and entity recognition, NLP systems can separate objective observations from emotional reactions. This enhances categorization accuracy and allows businesses to respond more effectively. For example, objective text referring to technical features may require different action than highly subjective comments expressing satisfaction or frustration. Entity-aware subjectivity analysis clarifies which parts of a product or service are drawing specific types of reactions. This combined approach produces structured insights that guide product, marketing, and support decisions.",
