    "body_markdown": "# Add Sentiment Analysis to Any App in 5 Minutes\n\nMost apps already collect text: reviews, support tickets, chat logs, survey responses, and more. The problem is they rarely **measure** what people feel.\n\nIn this quick guide, we will wire up a simple API that turns any free text into:\n\n- Overall sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)\n- Polarity and subjectivity scores\n- Emotion hints (joy, anger, fear, trust)\n- Keywords and key phrases\n\n## 1. Get an API key\n\nSubscribe to the **Text Sentiment & NLP Insights API** on RapidAPI and copy your key.\n\n## 2. Make your first request (JavaScript)\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"https://text-sentiment-nlp-insights-api.p.rapidapi.com/v1/basic\", {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  headers: {\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"X-RapidAPI-Key\": \"YOUR_KEY\",\n    \"X-RapidAPI-Host\": \"text-sentiment-nlp-insights-api.p.rapidapi.com\"\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({ text: \"I love how easy this is to use.\" })\n})\n  .then(res => res.json())\n  .then(console.log);\n```\n\n## 3. Example use cases\n\n- Rank customer reviews by sentiment\n- Flag angry or frustrated support tickets\n- Track the emotional tone of community feedback over time\n\nOnce it is wired in, you can treat the API as a simple scoring function wherever you already handle text."
